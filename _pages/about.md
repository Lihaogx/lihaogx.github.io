Hello, I am Hao Li, a third-year Ph.D. student at the School of Electronic Information at Wuhan University, under the supervision of Professor [Hao Jiang](http://eis.whu.edu.cn/index/szdwDetail?rsh=00007828&newskind_id=20160320222026165YIdDsQIbgNtoE). My research interests lie in the integration of social networks, graph neural networks, and large language models.

üîé Research
======
My research interests lie in the integration of social networks, graph neural networks, and large language models. Specifically, I work in the following areas:

1. **Graph Neural Networks**
   - Dynamic Graph Embedding
   - Persistent Homology on graphs

2. **Social Networks and Graph Neural Networks**
   - Opinion Dynamics on Graphs
   - Special Structures in Social Graphs

3. **Large Language Models and Social Sciences**
   - Agents and Social Simulation
   - Sociological Research Methods Enhanced by Large Language Models
